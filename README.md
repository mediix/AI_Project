Using pandas and scikit-learn for classification tasks

```
bash
git clone git@github.com:jseabold/depy.git
cd depy
pip install -r requirements.txt
ipython notebook --notebook-dir=.
```
I was able to collect data in the process of the monitoring the environment data.
To run some machine learning algorithms on data I have been using iPython notebook
to be able to go through my code execution step-by-step.

To be able to follow the code simply install the requirements of the project and run
the iPython notebook to see the resutls.
